Hi!!
My name is Matthew and I'm currently undergoing a Bachelor's of Business majoring in Finance and Computer Science.
Not going to lie, I much more enjoy the computer science part as I really lose myself in time working on coding assignments and doing little side projects with the coding I have learnt.
I am proficient in Python, R and Java.
Welcome to my GitHub :DD
